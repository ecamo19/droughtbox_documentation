title: Dermination of residual water loss from small branches 
---

This protocol describes how to measure g<sub>res</sub> under __constant temperature and relative humidity__ 

## Procedure

## Materials-Equipments

+ Paraffine wax
+ Scale
+ Scanner
+ ImageJ

### Plant material preparation 

+ Collect 1 to 1.5 meters long branches  
+ Cut the end of each branch underwater
+ Rehydrate plants overnight by immersing them in water
+ Cover the branches with black plastic bags and store them dark conditions

### Before starting the measurements

+ Recut a 40 cm long branch (weight should not be larger than 500 grams)
+ Seal the end of the branch with paraffine wax 
+ Measure the fresh weight of each branch
+ Before placing the branches inside the Box, set the temperature and relative humidity values and wait until these stabilize
+ Check there is water in the reservoir located inside the box
### During the measurements 




## Data Analysis

$$E = \frac{slope(n_w;t)}{LA\ +\ BA }$$


$$g_{res}= \frac{E}{VPD}\ \times 101.6$$
### Code
```python
import pandas
```

This protocol describes how tro

## Procedure

## Materials-Equipments

+ Paraffine wax
+ Scale
+ 

### Plant material preparation 

+ Collect 1 to 1.5 meters long branches  
+ Cut the end of each branch underwater
+ Rehydrate plants overnight by immersing them in water
+ Cover the branches with black plastic bags and store them dark conditions

### Before starting the measurements

+ Recut a 40 cm long branch (weight should not be larger than 500 grams)
+ Seal the end of the branch with paraffine wax 
+ Measure the fresh weight of each branch
+ 
### During measurements 

+ 

$$\frac{1}{1}$$
